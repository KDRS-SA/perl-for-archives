Municipal Archive institutions Digital Resource Centre SA (KDRS) is a national collaboration within the municipal archive institutions. KDRS has fourteen members. Through their association with local and regional authorities, this represents 70% of the country's municipalities and counties. We expect that more institutions will want to become members of KDRS in the years ahead.

The reason for the creation of KDRS is that the municipal archive institutions recognized the major challenge that is associated with the handling of digital archives within the municipal sector. They realized that the challenge is too great for the individual institutions to be able to deal with this individually. KDRSâ€™ mission is to work on digital archives on behalf of all of the municipal archive institutions.

KDRS has developed working processes based on OAIS for digital repository that our members can use. In addition to that, we have built up a digital repository for our members to store digital archival packages (AIP) with copies in three geographic locations.

KDRS is a small organization, but personnel from our member institutions participate in most of our projects. An annual membership fee from the members primarily finances KDRS. We also receive some funding for specific projects from the national government. All municipal archive institutions can become members. KDRS is a non-profit company.
